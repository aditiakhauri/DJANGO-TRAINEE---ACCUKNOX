By default, Django signals are executed synchronously. This means that when a signal is triggered, the signal handler (receiver) is executed in the same thread and process as the sender, blocking the flow of the program until the handler completes.

To demonstrate this, I'll provide a code snippet in q1.py that proves Django signals are synchronous by default.


*EXPLANATION OF CODE:*

We define a signal my_signal using Django's Signal() class.
The signal handler (my_signal_handler) introduces a 5-second delay using time.sleep().
We print timestamps before sending the signal (start_time) and after the signal has been processed (end_time).
Since the handler introduces a delay of 5 seconds, if signals are synchronous, the end_time will be 5 seconds later than the start_time.


*CONCLUSION FROM THE OUTPUT*

As you can see from the output, the signal is processed synchronously. The main program execution is blocked during the 5-second delay in the signal handler. This conclusively proves that Django signals, by default, are executed synchronously.

If the signals were asynchronous, the signal would be sent and the program would continue immediately without waiting for the 5-second delay.
