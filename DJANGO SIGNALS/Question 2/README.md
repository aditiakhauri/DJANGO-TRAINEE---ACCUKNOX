Yes, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller by default. This means that when a signal is triggered, its receiver is executed in the same thread as the signal sender, blocking the flow of the program until the receiver completes its task.

To demonstrate this behavior, we can create a simple example (shown in q2.py)where we trigger a signal and check if both the signal sender and the receiver are running in the same thread.

*EXPLANATION*

We define a custom signal my_signal using Django's Signal class.
The signal handler (my_signal_handler) prints the current thread's name using threading.current_thread().name and simulates processing.
We connect the signal to the handler using my_signal.connect().
When the signal is sent, both the sender and the handler print the thread names they are executed in.

*CONCLUSION*

As shown in the output, both the signal sender and the signal handler run in the same thread (MainThread). This conclusively proves that Django signals are executed synchronously and in the same thread as the caller by default. If you require signals to run asynchronously, you would need to implement custom logic, such as using threading or task queues (e.g., Celery).
