By default, Django signals do not necessarily run in the same database transaction as the caller, unless the signal is explicitly connected to run after the transaction is committed. Django's built-in signals (e.g., post_save, pre_save) are typically triggered before or after a database operation but do not wrap themselves inside the same database transaction as the caller unless you explicitly manage that behavior.

To conclusively prove whether Django signals run in the same transaction, I can use a Django signal (like post_save) and simulate a situation where the transaction fails or succeeds, and observe if the signal's execution is tied to the transaction(q3.py).

*INITIAL APPROACHES:*

Running Migrations via makemigrations and migrate:

What I tried: I attempted to run migrations using call_command('makemigrations', '__main__') and call_command('migrate', app_label='__main__') to generate the migration files for the MyModel model and apply them.
Issue: The error App '__main__' does not have migrations was raised because Django expected __main__ to be a formal Django app with migrations and a structured folder, which is not the case in a standalone script like this one.
Using --run-syncdb:

What I tried: After the failure of migrations, I used call_command('migrate', '--run-syncdb') to directly synchronize the database and create the tables for the MyModel without relying on migrations.
Issue: Even though --run-syncdb creates tables for unmigrated apps, Django still treated __main__ as an app with migrations (because I had attempted makemigrations earlier), and this led to the error no such table: __main___mymodel.
Attempting syncdb without migrations:

What I tried: I continued using --run-syncdb, which is designed to synchronize the database schema, but since Django had already flagged the app as requiring migrations, it did not create the tables for MyModel.
Issue: The error persisted, and no table was created for MyModel.

*Final Working Solution:*

Using schema_editor() to Create the Table Manually:
What I finally did: I bypassed the entire migration system by directly using Django's schema_editor() to manually create the table for MyModel. This approach directly interacts with the database, ensuring the necessary table is created without needing migrations.

Why it worked: Using schema_editor() allows us to create the database schema for a model manually. In standalone scripts or testing environments (like this one), this is an effective way to create tables without needing Django's formal app structure or migration system. This method is especially useful in simplified testing environments like in-memory SQLite databases.

Why the Final Solution Worked:
Manual Table Creation: Instead of relying on migrations (which require a formal app structure), I used Django's low-level database utilities (schema_editor) to manually create the table for MyModel.
Bypassing Migrations: Since migrations are not needed in this simplified setup, using schema_editor() ensures that the modelâ€™s table is created without relying on the migration process.
Standalone Script: The script runs in a non-traditional Django environment (no real apps or migrations), so directly working with the schema was a better fit for this scenario.

*EXPLANATION*

Model and Signal: I define a simple model (MyModel) and a post_save signal that logs when the signal is triggered.
Transaction: I wrap the creation of a MyModel instance inside a transaction (transaction.atomic()). During the transaction, I force a rollback by raising an exception.
Expected Behavior: If the signal runs in the same transaction, the signal should not be executed when the transaction fails (i.e., the post_save signal should not be triggered). If the signal runs outside the transaction, it will still be triggered even though the transaction rolls back.

*CONCLUSION*

By default, Django signals do not run in the same database transaction as the caller. As the post_save signal is triggered even if the transaction rolls back, it indicates that the signal is not tied to the transaction unless you explicitly wrap it in a transaction.on_commit() to ensure it only runs when the transaction is successfully committed.

If you need the signal to be executed only after a successful transaction, you should use transaction.on_commit() [see q3-2.py]
